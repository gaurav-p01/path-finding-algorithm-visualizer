# path-finding-algorithm-visualizer


~ click on the grid to place the starting block and then click elsewhere to add the end block
<br>
~ click again to place barriers 
<br>
~ you can delete barriers and other blocks by clicking on them with the right mouse button
<br>
~ press space to clear the whole grid
<br>
~ after placing the start and end blocks press enter to start the algorithm and visualize the path
<br>
~ press enter to retrace the path or press space to clear the grid and start again
<br>
~ might add some more algorithms and some gui to change grid dimensions and theme later. you can change them in the code for now.

feedback is appreciated :)
