# path-finding-algorithm-visualizer

click on the grid to place the starting block and then click elsewhere to add the end block
click again to place barriers 
you can delete barriers and other blocks by clicking on them with the right mouse button
press space to clear the whole grid
after placing the start and end blocks press enter to start the algorithm and visualize the path
press enter to retrace the path or press space to clear the grid and start again
might add some more algorithms and some gui to change grid dimensions and theme later. you can change them in the code for now.

feedback is appreciated :)
